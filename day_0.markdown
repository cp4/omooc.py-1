* Markdown

	Q[1]: Couldn't insert pictures in Markdown file. 

		1. local pics stored in the same directory as the MD file can be referred in a relative path: [/pics/pic.jpg]
		2. push pics into GitHub/dropbox to acquire a URL: [https://github.com/yzha3917/omooc.py/blob/master/pics/gitbook.jpg]
		3. If the image is still failed to render, [?raw=true] should be append to the url/relative path. 


	Q[2]: Need to resize the pic. 
	
	A: For Mou editor, instead of appending [?raw=true], [ =100x100] could be uesd for resizing. 100 means 100 pixels, and the first number is for width, the 2nd one is for height.
